			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks focusing on library installation, performance benchmarking, collision testing, and database schema creation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves validating two distinct libraries (cl-bodge for Lisp backend and Matter.js for frontend), setting up benchmarks for real-time performance with 500 objects, and creating database schemas. It requires cross-platform testing and performance tuning, but it's more proof-of-concept than full implementation, leading to moderate complexity. Dependencies are minimal, and testing is focused on validation rather than integration."

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks focusing on universe management, component system implementation, fixed timestep loop, WebSocket handlers, and database integration.",
			"reasoning": "This task builds the core authoritative physics simulation with real-time threading, component-based architecture, and WebSocket integration. It involves significant technical challenges like ensuring 60 Hz simulation stability, handling force fields, and persisting state, with dependencies on the previous validation phase. Testing requires performance and correctness under load."

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks focusing on physics predictor implementation, canvas manager extension, WebSocket message handling, and UI controls development.",
			"reasoning": "This task integrates client-side prediction with existing PixiJS rendering, requiring synchronization between ghost and server objects, real-time rendering optimizations, and UI additions. High complexity due to the need for low-latency prediction, collision handling, and maintaining 60 FPS with 500 objects, building on backend dependencies."

			"taskTitle": "Phase 3: Multiplayer Sync & Polish",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks focusing on delta compression, monitoring metrics, determinism testing, load testing, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task optimizes synchronization and performance for multiplayer scenarios, involving bandwidth reduction, latency monitoring, and rigorous testing (determinism and load). It requires profiling and optimization of real-time systems, with moderate complexity due to the polish and testing focus, depending on prior integration phases."

			"taskTitle": "Phase 4: Component System & Extensibility",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this task into subtasks focusing on gravity adjustment feature, post-MVP component implementation, developer documentation, performance profiling, and architecture validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task demonstrates extensibility by adding features and documenting the system, with performance profiling and API validation. Complexity is lower as it builds on existing architecture, but involves new component development, documentation, and profiling, with dependencies on prior phases."

		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up Auth0 configuration and environment variables",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of Auth0 configuration into subtasks focusing on creating the configuration module, implementing helper functions, and adding validation for environment variables.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves straightforward configuration and helper functions with moderate effort for secure secret handling and testing, but no major technical challenges beyond standard practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Update database schema to support Auth0 fields",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the database schema update into subtasks for executing SQL changes and ensuring data migration with backward compatibility.",
			"reasoning": "Database migrations require careful handling to avoid data loss and ensure indexing, adding moderate complexity due to integration testing needs and potential rollback scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement OAuth2 authorization flow initiation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the OAuth2 flow initiation into subtasks covering state token generation, temporary storage, and redirect handling with expiry mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Involves security aspects like CSRF protection and threading for state cleanup, increasing complexity with dependencies on configuration and testing for state validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement OAuth2 callback and token exchange",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the callback handling into subtasks for state validation, token exchange via HTTP, response parsing, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Requires integration with external APIs for token exchange, error handling, and mocking in tests, raising complexity due to dependencies and potential network issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement JWT ID token decoding and validation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide JWT handling into tasks for decoding, signature validation with JWKS, claim validation, and caching mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Cryptographic operations like signature verification and JWKS fetching introduce high technical challenges, with dependencies on prior tasks and need for robust error handling in testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement user finding and creation from OAuth data",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand user management into subtasks for finding existing users, creating new ones, updating records, and handling legacy account linking with transactions.",
			"reasoning": "Database transactions and logic for user matching/linking add complexity, especially with integration tests and dependencies on schema and JWT validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement session creation and cookie management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide session handling into subtasks for creating sessions and setting secure cookies with proper attributes.",
			"reasoning": "Focuses on secure session management with specific security flags, moderate effort but requires integration testing across requests and dependencies on user creation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Update frontend for Auth0 login integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down frontend updates into subtasks for modifying the AuthManager class, updating UI elements, and supporting dual-mode authentication.",
			"reasoning": "Involves UI changes and JavaScript updates with manual testing, moderate complexity due to transition support and dependencies on backend OAuth flows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement user migration and linking flow",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the migration flow into subtasks for implementing the linking handler, updating UI banners, managing email campaigns, and ensuring database updates.",
			"reasoning": "Complex user flow requiring coordination between legacy and OAuth systems, with integration testing and dependencies on user management and frontend updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement monitoring, testing, and deprecation of legacy auth",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide the final phase into tasks for metrics collection, comprehensive testing, feature flag implementation, legacy deprecation, and monitoring setup.",
			"reasoning": "Encompasses full-system integration, extensive testing, and phased deprecation, with high complexity due to dependencies on all prior tasks and need for thorough validation."

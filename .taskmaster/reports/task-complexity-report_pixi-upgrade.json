			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Backup Current Codebase",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a straightforward Git operation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves basic Git commands with minimal technical challenges, low implementation effort, and simple testing, making it low complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Update Package Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this involves editing a single file and running a command.",
			"reasoning": "Editing package.json and running npm install is routine with low risk, though it has dependencies and requires careful verification to avoid breaking builds."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Imports Across Codebase",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for searching and replacing imports in each specific file (e.g., main.js, canvas.js, and any other PixiJS-using files).",
			"reasoning": "Requires searching and replacing across multiple files, with potential for errors if not all imports are caught; moderate effort and testing to ensure no import issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Asynchronous Initialization",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this focuses on refactoring a single file's initialization logic.",
			"reasoning": "Involves understanding PixiJS v8 async changes and refactoring code, with moderate technical challenges in async handling and testing for initialization errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Replace app.view with app.canvas",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a simple find-and-replace operation.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward search and replace in specific files, low effort, but requires DOM inspection testing to ensure canvas references work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Graphics API to Builder Pattern",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for updating each drawing function (e.g., createRectangle, createCircle) to the new builder pattern, including testing each shape individually.",
			"reasoning": "Significant refactor of drawing logic across multiple functions, high implementation effort, technical challenges in adapting to new API, and extensive testing for rendering correctness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Update Shape Function Names",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a rename operation across Graphics usage.",
			"reasoning": "Involves renaming methods in Graphics calls, moderate effort to ensure all instances are updated, with testing for shape rendering."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Use Style Objects for Fills and Strokes",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this updates API calls in shape creation.",
			"reasoning": "Changes fill and stroke calls to object-based style, moderate effort with dependencies on prior Graphics changes, requiring styling verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Replace updateTransform with onRender",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this refactors custom logic in specific classes.",
			"reasoning": "Refactors to new onRender hook, moderate technical challenges in binding and replacing methods, with testing for render cycle execution."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Update getBounds Usage",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this adjusts getBounds calls to new format.",
			"reasoning": "Changes to getBounds().rectangle, moderate effort with dependencies, requiring bounding box testing for accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Update Ticker Callback",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this modifies a single callback.",
			"reasoning": "Adjusts Ticker callback to use ticker.deltaTime, low effort but critical for animations, with performance testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Replace PIXI.utils Imports",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this updates import statements.",
			"reasoning": "Changes utils imports to direct from pixi.js, moderate effort to find and update all, with error checking in testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CullerPlugin for Performance",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this adds and configures a plugin.",
			"reasoning": "Involves importing and adding a plugin, setting properties, moderate effort with performance monitoring testing."
